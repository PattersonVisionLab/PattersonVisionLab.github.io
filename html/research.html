                    The ability to functionally classify ganglion cells in the living eye, then return to study the same cells in subsequent experiments forms the foundation of the lab's research. We can currently distinguish over 20 distinct functional classes based on their contrast, spectral, spatial and temporal tuning. The ongoing effort to improve classification stimuli and analyses allows us to continue learning new things about foveal ganglion cells and often reveals exciting new research directions. We are also interested in utilizing connectomics to determine the underlying circuitry responsible for the exciting new response properties identified with calcium imaging.
                    <br>
                    Our ultimate goal is to identify the very best stimuli for each ganglion cells type, ones that get at the heart of each neuron's role in vision.

                    Research in this area focuses on specific cell types (e.g., ON direction-selective ganglion cells) or population coding of specific visual features (e.g., visual signals created by eye movements).

                        Critical to our work is the ability to non-invasively study retinal structure and function in the living eye with adaptive optics. This approach enables longitudinal imaging of the same retinal neurons for months or years. This provides unique opportunities to study the response properties of retinal ganglion cells in depth, the progression of retinal degeneration, and to establish direct links between ganglion cell function and behavior.
                        <br>
                        We use a fluorescence adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope, which is essentially a confocal microscope with the added capability of detecting and correcting for the eye's aberrations in real time. Viral vector-mediated gene delivery is used to express genetically encoded calcium indicators in the ganglion cell layer, which allows us to monitor the activity of hundreds of ganglion cells simultaneously while presenting visual stimuli.
                        <br>
                        Functional retinal imaging with adaptive optics is still a relatively new technique and there are many opportunities to make substantial technical advances for students who are interested in optics, engineering, or computer science. Potential projects in this area include implementing high-speed imaging strategies to improve the temporal bandwidth of calcium imaging and detect action potentials with voltage imaging.

                        Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) slices through a volume of neural tissue, acquiring high-resolution (5 nm/pixel) EM images of each section. The resulting volume enables reconstructing neural circuits and their synaptic contacts in 3D, providing a comprehensive account of each ganglion cell type's upstream circuitry. We seek to establish a feedback loop between physiology and anatomy, using connectomics to guide physiological characterization of rarer ganglion cell types and to determine the origins of observed responses. Connectomics will also be used to obtain a detailed understanding of the remodeling that occurs after retrograde degeneration of the dominant ganglion cell type following V1 damage.
